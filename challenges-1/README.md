CSS Card using HTML & CSS. (Responsive)

Using some knowledge and copy some code.

The idea is keep working and growing just learning how to code visualizing and capting all the organization of the code and how others Devs work, the way they code and some other stuff.

I just enjoy my travel learning to code!
